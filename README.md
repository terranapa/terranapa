- 👋 Hi, I’m @terranapa
- 👀 I’m interested in building tools that help people pay themselves with time. My first tool is designed for attorneys to help them flip the billable hour on its head.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about time! And how to build and scale these tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on useful tools for the legal profession. I'm an attorney by trade, so my tools tend to focus on lawyers. Also open to supporting other creators and founders with their legal needs as you scale your business.
